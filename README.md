# JavaScript

A place to learn JavaScript using *Markdown* and *Jupyter Notebook*. Inside `src` you'll find notebooks that explain JavaScript features with some code examples.

Feel free to contribute adding new notebooks.

## Usage

IJavascript is a Javascript kernel for the Jupyter notebook. Install it by running:
```shell
npm install -g ijavascript
```
To install the dependencies and use the notebook you'll need `pipenv`:
```shell
pip3 install pipenv
```
Start the virtual environment typing:
```shell
pipenv shell
```
Install the dependencies using:
```shell
pipenv install
```
Inside the activated virtual environment, install the javascript kernel by running:
```shell
ijsinstall
```
Start Jupyter Lab with:
```shell

```
